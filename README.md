# Flip-n-Slide: A Concise Tiling Strategy for Preserving Spatial Context in Earth Observation Imagery (ML4RS @ ICLR 2024)

A PyTorch-enabled implementation of our ML4RS @ ICLR 2024 paper "A Concise Tiling Strategy for Preserving Spatial Context in Earth Observation Imagery". Flip-n-Slide is a concise tiling strategy for large scientific images that preserves spatial context in preprocessing for use with GPU-enabled deep learning algorithms. Flip-n-Slide allows objects-of-interest to be represented at multiple tile positions and orientations, improving the detection of underrepresented classes in cases of class imbalance from preprocessing alone. This approach can also be implemented alongside optimizations and architectures for cases of extreme class imbalance (<1% of overall data) to allow for even better accuracy and prediction.

## Here will go instructions for use when ready.
