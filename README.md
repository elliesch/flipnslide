# Flip-n-Slide
## A Concise Tiling Strategy for Preserving Spatial Context in Earth Observation Imagery 

Flip-n-Slide is a concise tiling strategy for large scientific images that preserves spatial context in preprocessing for use with GPU-enabled deep learning algorithms. Flip-n-Slide allows objects-of-interest to be represented at multiple tile positions and orientations, improving the detection of underrepresented classes (<5% of overall data) in cases of class imbalance from preprocessing alone. This approach can also be implemented alongside optimizations and architectures for cases of extreme class imbalance (<1% of overall data) to allow for even better accuracy and prediction.

## Here will go instructions for use when ready.
